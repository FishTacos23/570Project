%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This program solves and displays structural simulations
using the Structure Stiffness Method. The current edition
is set up to only allow for Plane Frames but future work 
could easily modify this to accept Plane Trusses, Space Frames
and Space Trusses.

******************* Creating the Structure **************************

To have a valid structure you will need 5 things

1.) Joints
2.) Members
3.) Constraints
4.) Forces
5.) Properties

There are two options for creating a structure

1.) open an input file

	- File -> Open

2.) Interactively input with tool bars

	- Edit
	- Select the toolbar you wish to use

	
************************** Solving *****************************

When a structure has sufficient data the "SOLVE" button will
become activated. When clicked, a progress bar will show the 
progress of the solution and then remain green and full when
the solution is done.

Three options become active when a solution is done.

1.) Save Results
	
	- File -> Save Results

	This will save a text file with the joint displacements
	and the member support reactions

2.) Displacement

	This will allow the user to visualize how the structure 
	displaces

3.) Stress
	
	This will allow the user to visualize the support reactions
	on the member

	* It is not a true stress, just forces!

************************** Displacement ******************************

When the user clicks displace they will visualize how the displacement

Wheb the user moves the slide bar along the bottom of the screen the
magnification of the displacement will change with the scale factor 
showing to the side of the slide bar.

*************************** Stress *************************************

The user will see a single member with the support reactions displayed 
horizontally on the screen

To the left of this will be a map of the structure with the currently
visualized member highlighted

A toolbar will appear that will allow the user to change the selected
member

************************** Other Functions ***************************
   
   Clear

	Clears all information from the program

   UNDO

	The user may undo any command. 

   REDO

	The user may redo any undid command.

	* The undo/redo cash are emptied when the structure is solved
		or when you click clear

   Forces

	If checked the forces on the structure are displayed

   Constraints

	If checked the constraints on the structure are displayed
